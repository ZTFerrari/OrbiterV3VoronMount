*** PLEASE USE V1 STL's. this initiwl version is not opimized****


Howdy Y'all.

I ordered an Orbiter V3 due to the awesome engineering and packaging without thinking much how I would mount it on my Voron 2.4R2 350 w/ TAP.  That said, here is a mound and fan setup that works although there are a few issues.

The biggest issue is that due to the motor stickout, the motor will contact the grantry rails on X Max travel, so it looks like we will loose 10mm total travel.  The fan mount also sticks out and will hit at X min, so we loose some travel here.  total x travel lost due to the width is 20mm.

I also havnt tested to see if the heatsink will cause issues with the fan duct, not sure if the temperatures will get hot enough to melt the plastic and also cause airflow and/or cooling issues. work in progress I guess but I wont be continuing the design due to the x travel loss.  Here are all my design files, I am quite happy with the simplicity of the mounting system and cooling duct though, no supports needed and minimal weight.  Fan is a GBD4020
